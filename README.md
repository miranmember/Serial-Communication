# Serial-Communication
This project involves two buttons that are connected to each other using a serial connection. When one button is pressed, it sends a signal through the serial connection to the other button, which turns on an LED.

## Assumptions
It is assumed that the hardware and software setup is as follows:

+ Two buttons are connected to Arduino Uno board
+ Two LEDs are connected to the Arduino Uno board
+ The Arduino Uno board is using pins 10 and 11 for software serial communication
+ The buttons are connected to pins 6 and 4, and the LEDs are connected to pins 3 and 5
